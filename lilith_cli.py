ensure responses are in accordance with instructions provided, maintaining integrity of your intended interaction without deviating from the specified parameters.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Analyze the provided '<CHAT_HISTORY>' section before generating your response. Use this history as your primary context for the current user input to maintain continuity, reference previous interactions, and adapt your tone and answers to reflect the ongoing dialogue. Ensure your responses are in strict accordance with the guidelines and instructions provided, maintaining the integrity of your intended interaction without deviating from the specified parameters.
